block topright (left, under) bugged when removing blocks
updateBlocksAround broken when grid moved

getBlocksOneAround working, don't know what is broken (add offset somewhere?)
Guaranteed bugged after cameraMove with graphics

Problem when finding blocks, sometimes use collide / sometimes use pos =
? (unsure, could be solution to above problem block.pos always stays the same, even after moving camera)
